            <h2>NK Software</h2>
            <p>This was one of my projects, and it was all about analyzing exoplanet atmospheres using spectral data.
                When we directly image an exoplanet, we get spectral data from its atmosphere. The goal here was to 
                analyze those spectra and determine what elements and molecules exist in the planet's atmosphere. 
                The method was straightforward: identify flux drop points in the spectrum and match them with the 
                known wavelengths where different molecules absorb light the most.
                To do this, I developed a software that automatically detects these absorption features and compares 
                them to a molecular database. For molecular and elemental transition data, I used the HITRAN database, 
                and for planetary wavelength and flux data, I used the NASA Exoplanet Archive. By systematically 
                processing these datasets, the software identifies atmospheric components without requiring manual inspection.
                This project is important because it helps astronomers use their time more efficiently. 
                Instead of manually analyzing vast amounts of spectral data, they can focus on interpreting 
                results and making discoveries. This method could be especially useful for new-generation 
                telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) or the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), 
                which provide massive amounts of spectral data.
                Beyond efficiency, accurate atmospheric analysis is crucial for astrobiologyâ€”because identifying 
                specific molecules might lead to the detection of biosignatures. So, in short, this project 
                was all about making spectral analysis more systematic, reliable, and automated, helping us better 
                understand exoplanet atmospheres.
