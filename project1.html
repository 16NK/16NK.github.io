            <h2>Energy from rain, powering the future</h2>
            <p>
                This was my very first project. When I was in seventh grade, 
                I heard about TeknoFest and began creating. 
                As you can guess from the title, it's about generating energy from rain. 
                Rain, as we know, falls from clouds. And clouds are way up high above us.
                The idea was to convert the potential energy that raindrops gain at that 
                height into electrical energy using a dynamo. 
                I also built a miniature version of the house you see in the image and 
                tested the system at home. Even when it ran for just 30 seconds, 
                the generated energy was enough to power a house for an hour. 
                Unfortunately, back then, I didn't know how to write a proper project 
                report, so my project was eliminated in the second round.
