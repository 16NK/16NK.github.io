            <h2>Time</h2>
            <p>Time is not at all what it seems. It does not flow in only one direction, and the future exists simultaneously with the past.</p>
            <p>Here is the incredible result that emerges when we put together everything we know about 'Time.'</p>
                Even the conclusion we reach by considering everything we know leads to an unknown, so I guess we don’t know anything (but that’s a different topic).
                This quote is often attributed to Einstein. I couldn't find out exactly who it belongs to, but whoever it is, I think it’s the most comprehensive definition of time ever.
                <p>So, let's start talking about Time.</p>
                <p>If you know how much I value questions, you won’t question these titles, but if you don’t, you should definitely read the “Ask Questions” card under the “My Inspirations” section.</p>
                <p>Our first question: What is Time?</p>
                <p>Here are three different definitions from three different sources:</p>
                <p>1- The progression of the future from the past to the present.</p>
                <p>2- 9th Grade textbook: Time or duration is a continuity that can be measured or is measurable, with no spatial dimension.</p>
                <p>3- A one-way dimension.</p>
                <p>Since Time is something that the scientific world has not fully solved, we do not have a unified definition. Also, as you can see, the definitions contradict each other (2nd definition: continuity with no spatial dimension – No dimension; 3rd definition: one-way dimension – A dimension).</p>                
                <p>As you think of an answer to this question, let me ask the second one:</p>
                <p>Is Time Scalar or Vectorial?</p>
                
                <p>Can you classify a concept we don't fully understand? Of course not.
                <p>But, assuming you understand it, you can place these concepts into specific groups (This method usually doesn’t reflect reality. If it seems to work, your acceptance will eventually break down at some point).</p>            
                <p>Yes, currently, a large part of the scientific community considers time as a one-way dimension and classifies it as scalar.</p>
                
                <p>But if it even refers to a direction in its definition, how can it be classified as scalar?</p>
