                <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
                <p>Here is an astronomy-lover. Hello, My name is Nur Sima Karhan. I absolutely love talking about physics, astronomy, and astrophysics. But it's not just about talking—I want to truly understand, explore, and even contribute to science with my own projects.</p>
                <p>I'm also really into coding. I see programming not just as a skill, but as a powerful tool to unlock the secrets of the universe. That's why I'm learning C, C++, Python, HTML, and CSS. From developing an AI model that classifies galaxies to building robots, I love turning ideas into reality.</p>
                <p>I believe science isn't something you just read about—it's something you experience, question, and bring to life. That's why I enjoy sharing what I learn through TEDx-style presentations, where I break down complex topics into engaging and thought-provoking talks. For me, science is a journey, and sharing it with others makes it even more exciting.</p>
                <p>One of my big goals? To have my own observatory, away from the city lights and noises, where I can explore the universe with complete focus. The question of whether we are truly alone in the cosmos is one that fuels my curiosity—and I'm determined to find answers.</p>
                <p>I even express science through music, writing songs that reflect my wonder about it.</p>
                <p>In short, Science isn't just in my head; it's part of everything I do. I question it, share it, and build it. Science isn't just knowledge to me; it's a way of seeing and experiencing the world.
                    And special thanks to Ecrintrn for helping me with design of my website and giving me ideas about coding.
                </p>
